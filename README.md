## 💡 About the Project

Hi, I'm Igor Zhiznevskyi from Odesa, Ukraine.

After losing everything in the war, I built something meaningful — a decentralized art canvas made of **1,000,000 pixels**, where **every pixel can be bought** and customized with an image, message or link.

When the canvas is full, it will be turned into a **single NFT**, and auctioned.

✅ **100% of the auction proceeds go to charity (ICRC)**  
💰 **300,000 USDT in rewards for participants**
